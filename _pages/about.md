Beyond the Bioâ€¦
At a young age, I was fascinated by technology and travel. Without a doubt influenced by my grandparents. I remember my 4th-grade teacher, Ms. Dickson, once underlined the distinction between knowing what an airplane does and understanding how it functions. This concept raptured my mind. Aircraft continue to intrigue me, and a love for technology and the world continue to unravel a curiosity for how the innards of human consciousness interrelate with the environment.

Having worked in engineering projects internationally with top-level organizations gives me a leading experience both in mechanical engineering and data science. In addition, a background in athletics and training make me a nerd for health and performance.

Most of my time is spent growing in my field, training for ultramarathons, and reading.
