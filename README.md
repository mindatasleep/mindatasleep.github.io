# How to
Deploy your website to GitHub Pages by running the deploy script. By default, the script uses the `master` branch for the source code and deploys the webpage to `gh-pages`. The optional flag --user tells it to deploy to master and use source for the source code instead. Using master for deployment is a convention for user and organization pages.

```bundle exec jekyll serve```

```./bin/deploy [--user]```
